# WholeCell Summer School

The primary aim is to learn about standards for modelling and simulation in computational biology.  But a secondary aim is to enjoy modelling, coding and diagramming the whole-cell model using openly available software and COMBINE standards.

This module represents the *Replication* of the "whole-cell model" published in [Cell](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22817898) by Karr *et al.*.

The 'documentation' folder contains a text file that holds links to all the slides used throughout the workshop, in addition to meeting notes and a formal documentation. All image files are in this folder as well (images of simulations and PDFs of SBGN maps).

The 'interfaces' folder contains all the I/O tables for the integration team that would be needed in order to integrate our submodules with the rest of the whole-cell model.
